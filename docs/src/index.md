# Mongoc.jl

## Introduction

**Mongoc.jl** is a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) driver for the Julia Language.

It is implemented as a thin wrapper around [libmongoc](http://mongoc.org/),
the official client library for C applications.

Given that [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/) is the document format for MongoDB,
this package also implements a wrapper around [libbson](http://mongoc.org/libbson/current/index.html),
which provides a way to create and manipulate BSON documents.

## Requirements

* MongoDB 3.0 or newer.

* Julia versions v1.3 or newer.

* Linux, macOS

* Windows.

## Installation

From a Julia session, run:

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("Mongoc")
```
